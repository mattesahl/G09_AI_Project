## Research idea
**Title:** Stroke prediction  
**Proposal:**
During this project, we will analyze a dataset (www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) in order to build an AI model that can predict the likelihood of patients getting a stroke. The dataset that we will use contains information about around 5,000 patients, and each patient is described with 11 different clinical features. These features are the patient’s gender, age, average glucose level, BMI, residence type, smoking status, kind of work, marriage status, and also information if the patient has hypertension or a heart disease. By combining this dataset with machine learning techniques, we hope to create our AI model to gain reliable predictions. Furthermore, this project and our AI model might also help us to understand which of the 11 features might correlate most with stroke.
